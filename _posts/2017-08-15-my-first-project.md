## Mockup Design to Live Responsive Website
This project is my first responsive website using HTML picture element and CSS flex property.

The assignment was to create a responsive website that looks like the mockup design on an one page PDF. 

### The Mockup

Go to the [live website](https://susanschen.github.io/Mockup-to-Responsive/) and adjust the browser size to view the thumbnail grid change from three columns to one columns.
