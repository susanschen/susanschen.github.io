## Google Map, Wikipedia and Knockout Project

This project is a combination of three courses lessons: 
Google Map API, Intro to AJAX using Wikipedia API, and Using an Organization Library with Knockout.js.

## My thoughts on this project

Individually, the Google Map API and Wikipedia API mini-projects are easy to follow along in the course. 
Combining both of them with Knockout.js is harder than I thought. For a small project like this one, I felt that I could have finished coding faster without using Knockout. 
After finishing the project, I understand that using a model-view controller is helpful for large-scale projects, and using it on a small project,
like this one, introduce me to thinking in a more structured format which allows for scalabity.
