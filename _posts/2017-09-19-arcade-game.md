## Project Description
This game is the third project in the intermediate javascript part of the Front-End Nanodegree course on Udacity. Udacity provided the game engine and image assets on [Github](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).

### Basic Project Requirements
Upon opening the provided index.html, a student is faced with a blank screen. As a student, I have to write code to get the game started and to complete the game from setting up the enemies' and player's locations,  moving the player based on a user's keys input, moving the enemies across the screen at random speed and interval, testing for canvas boundary, testing for the player's collision with an enemy, and resetting the game once the player reaches the water.

### Extra Functionality
Beyond completing the basic project requirement, I have chosen to add extra game features to make the game more challenging and fun. I added rocks as obstacles to limit the player's movement and gems to entice the player to keep playing by rewarding points.

## How to Play
Move the player by using the arrow keys for "up", "down", "left", and "right".

In this game, which is based on Frogger, a classic arcade game from 1981, you have to get the boy across the road to the river without getting run over by bugs. The game resets if a bug hits the boy.

You get 100 points for reaching the water and 25 points for each gem. Try to collect as many gems as you can to score higher.
