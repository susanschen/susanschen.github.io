Pixel art maker is written in Javascript with the requirment to use loops, functions, selectors, and event listeners to complete the project. The code uses selectors to get DOM elements and the user input values for width, height and color. Upon the user submitting the width and height for the grid size, the function makeGrid() uses loops to create the rows and columns to display the grid.  The code uses event listeners to trigger grid creation, open up a color-picker, and modify the grid colors.

Each cell is a HTML table data, and I use CSS backgroun-color declaration to achieve the color change.
