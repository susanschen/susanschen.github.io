This project demonstrates the value of a "test-driven development" process.  The original [project assets](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader) contains a pre-existing feedreader application and an incomplete JavaScript specification file that must be completed by the student.

## Testing Framework 

[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) is used as the framework for testing the feedreader app.  For this project, students have to create seven testing specifications, which must all pass. 

Jasmine does all the testing automatically and displays the results at the bottom of the webpage if all test specifications pass. If any specification fails, Jasmine will not load the feedreader and will display which test has failed.

Here's a screenshot of the Jasmine test results.
