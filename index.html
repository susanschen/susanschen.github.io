  <h1>Hi there, I'm Susan Chen!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio. I learned how to use Github in August of 2017, and I have used it to keep track of my learning process. The projects I have done so far are for <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity's</a> Front-End Web Developer course.</p>
  <p>The course curriculum teaches students how to develop responsive sites and how to code in javascript, and I created five projects within two months. All of the projects and the corresponding code are availabe on my <a href="https://github.com/susanschen">github account</a>. </p>
