  <h1>Hi there, I'm Susan Chen!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio. 
    I learned how to use Github in August of 2017, and I have used it to keep track of my learning process. 
    The projects I have done so far are for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer course, which I graduated from in two months with self-paced learning.  </p>

    I based my site on [JONATHAN MCGLONE's](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) step-by-step guide to creating a website with Jekyll.</p>
