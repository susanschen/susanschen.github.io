  <h1>Hi there, I'm Susan Chen!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio. I learned how to use Github in August of 2017, and I have used it to keep track of my learning process. The projects I have done so far are for <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity's</a> Front-End Web Developer course, which I graduated from in two months with self-paced learning.</p>
